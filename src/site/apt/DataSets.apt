Data Sets -  put your database in an predefined state

  The concepts of InitialDataSets provide a convenient way to populate your test database (default the in memory database)
  with a predefined set of data. This means every test can rely on a well defined set of data, loaded into the database, 
  every time a test is executed.
  
  
  Ejb3Unit comes with two different InitialDataSet implementations:
  
  * EntityInitialDataSet - provides a way to programatically create instances of persistent
    objects. This objects are automatically persistent before every test execution and after the test 
    completes this data is deleted again. 
    
  * CSVInitialDataSet - provides a way to populate your test data base with larger amount of data. The
    data is loaded from a comma separated value files (CSV) and stored in the database before every 
    test run. CSVInitialDataSet supports also relational data (e.g.a Order can be loaded with 
    the LineItems of this Order).
    
EntityInitialDataSet

  The following example shows how sets of persistent objects can be created programatically. Yoy
  need to extend the base class EntityInitialDataSet:
  
----
public static class OrderInitialDataSet extends
			EntityInitialDataSet<Order> {

		public StockWKNEntityInitialDataSet() {
			super(Order.class);
		}

		public void create() {
			this.add(new Order(1, "First Order"));
			this.add(new Order(2, "Second Order"));

		}
----   

  An instance of "OrderInitialDataSet" can be passed to a {{{Sesstion-Bean.html} SessionBeanFixture}} or 
  a {{{POJOFixture.html}} POJO}} fixture to prepopulate every test with this Order data.
