/**
 * The delivery modes supported by the JMS API are <CODE>PERSISTENT</CODE> and
 * <CODE>NON_PERSISTENT</CODE>.
 * 
 * <P>
 * A client marks a message as persistent if it feels that the application will
 * have problems if the message is lost in transit. A client marks a message as
 * non-persistent if an occasional lost message is tolerable. Clients use
 * delivery mode to tell a JMS provider how to balance message transport
 * reliability with throughput.
 * 
 * <P>
 * Delivery mode covers only the transport of the message to its destination.
 * Retention of a message at the destination until its receipt is acknowledged
 * is not guaranteed by a <CODE>PERSISTENT</CODE> delivery mode. Clients
 * should assume that message retention policies are set administratively.
 * Message retention policy governs the reliability of message delivery from
 * destination to message consumer. For example, if a client's message storage
 * space is exhausted, some messages may be dropped in accordance with a
 * site-specific message retention policy.
 * 
 * <P>
 * A message is guaranteed to be delivered once and only once by a JMS provider
 * if the delivery mode of the message is <CODE>PERSISTENT</CODE> and if the
 * destination has a sufficient message retention policy.
