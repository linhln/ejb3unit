This library contains an implementation of a JNDI 1.1 naming provider. JNDI is 
normally used to configure J2EE application. With this library you can use JNDI 
to configure any application. The <code>MemoryContext</code> class is a naming 
provider and implements the <code>javax.naming.Context</code> interface. A 
<code>MemoryContext</code> instance resides completely in memory. A 
<code>MemoryContext</code> is capable of storing any type of Java object 
including references and reference factories.<p>

<h2>Installation and Use</h2>
Installation consists of placing a copy of the memory context classes in your
classpath. A version of Apache commons logging classes and some java helper 
classes are also required. All jar files required to build, test, and deploy are 
supplied in the lib directory of the distribution. Just place a copy of jndi.jar, 
commons-logging.jar, and util.jar in your classpath.<p>

Once installed, a <code>MemoryContext</code> is used just like any JNDI context. 
First you create an initial context. Using the initial context you can lookup 
any stored object by it's name.<p>

<code>
Context ctx = new InitialContext();<br>
Object ABC = ctx.lookup("ABC")
</code><p>

A new initial context will create a <code>MemoryContext</code> when the classes
in this library are on the classpath. If necessary, <code>InitialContext</code> 
can be forced to create a memory context by setting the INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY 
property prior to calling the <code>InitialContext</code> constructor.<p>

<code>
env.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, "jndi.naming.provider.MemoryContextFactory");<br>
Context ctx = new InitialContext(env);
</code><p>

The name format supported is the standard Java format with name parts separated
by "/" characters. Objects in the current context will always have names without 
any "/". A name with a "/" indicates that it resides in a naming context that is 
a a sub-context of the current context.<p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
A <code>MemoryContext</code> is easily configured from an xml document. To 
configure <code>MemoryContext</code> a JAXP Sax parser must exist in the 
classpath. Unless a different file name is specified the file, "jndi.xml", will 
be used to configure the naming provider. The configuration file is loaded from 
the classpath of your application.<p>

A differnet file name can be specified as the value of a property named 
<i>jndi.naming.provider.xml</i>. This property can be set as either a global
system property or as a property in the environment <code>Hashtable</code> 
passed to the constructor of <code>InitialContext</code>. Since the configuration 
file is loaded from the classpath of your application, only the file name should
be given.<p>

<code>
env.put(MemoryContextFactory.CONFIG_FILE, "example.xml");<br>
Context ctx = new InitialContext(env);
</code><p>

See {@link jndi.config.XMLConfigurator XMLConfigurator} for details of the xml 
configuration file format.<p>
