# What are the features of ejb3unit?

* Ejb3Unit is a JUnit extention and can execute automated standalone junit tests for all EJB 3.0 conform JEE projects.
* The out of container test approach leads to short build-test-cycles, because no container deployment is necessary anymore.
* EJb3Unit uses an internal in memory database by default. Alternatively a user defined database can be specified. An example configuration can be found here.
* Ejb3unit is released under the LGPL License.
